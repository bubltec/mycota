# Working in this repo

Agent instructions live in [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/), the single source of
truth (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the index). Do not add rules to this file.

The always-apply rules are imported here so Claude Code loads them every session:

@.cursor/rules/sync-before-code-changes.mdc
@.cursor/rules/release-on-merge.mdc
@.cursor/rules/recover-from-merged-branch.mdc

Read `.cursor/rules/mycota-solution-architecture.mdc` before changing package structure,
dependencies, manifests, tests or the release flow.
